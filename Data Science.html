									<h3 class="major">The Aim of the Project</h3>
									<p>This project aims to provide valuable assistance to two specific groups: freshly graduates and individuals seeking to shift their career paths. For freshly graduates, the project aims to offer insights and guidance in selecting a suitable career pathway within the field of data science. By analyzing job trends, experience levels, and salary variations, the project equips graduates with valuable information to make informed decisions about their career trajectories. Additionally, for those looking to shift their careers, the project provides a comprehensive analysis of the data science job market, offering insights into the skills and experiences required for a successful transition.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Stages of the Project: Collect, Process & Visualize</h3>
									<p>I extract crucial data points from diverse sources, employing MySQL for efficient data processing, cleaning, and analysis. By leveraging the power of MySQL, I ensure the dataset is refined and optimized for further exploration. Furthermore, I utilize the Tableau platform to create visually compelling visualizations, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the data.</p> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023"><b>"Data Source: Data Science Salaries 2023 (Kaggle)"</b></a></p>

									<h3 class="major">The End Results: MySQL File & Tableau Visualization</h3>
